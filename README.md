# connection_web
Displays a graph built from a data file of connections with networkx and matplotlib. Good for displaying and modeling any sort of connection network. A sample data file is provided. Entries should be added how they are shown in the sample file. It's
optional to include duplicate connections (ie. Bill and Fred & Fred and Bill; only one pair is needed). It's also fine to
include spaces and initials in names (ie. Jim B.).
